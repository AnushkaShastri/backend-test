# Serverless Framework Node REST API on AWS

This component creates  a simple ping  API with Node.js running on AWS Lambda and API Gateway using the traditional Serverless Framework.





### Deployment


```
$ serverless deploy
```



After running deploy, you should see output similar to:

```bash
Serverless: Packaging service...
Serverless: Excluding development dependencies...
Serverless: Creating Stack...
Serverless: Checking Stack create progress...
........
Serverless: Stack create finished...
Serverless: Uploading CloudFormation file to S3...
Serverless: Uploading artifacts...
Serverless: Uploading service aws-node-rest-api.zip file to S3 (711.23 KB)...
Serverless: Validating template...

Service Information
service: aws-node-rest-api
stage: dev
region: us-east-1
stack: aws-node-rest-api-dev
resources: 12
api keys:
  None
endpoints:
  ANY - https://xxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/
functions:
  api: aws-node-rest-api-dev-ping
layers:
  None
```

_Note_: In current form, after deployment, your API is public and can be invoked by anyone. For production deployments, you might want to configure an authorizer. For details on how to do that, refer to [http event docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/apigateway/).

### Invocation

After successful deployment, you can call the created application via HTTP:

```bash
curl https://xxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/api/ping
```

Which should result in response similar to the following :

```json
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "body": "{Ping Successful!!}"
}
```

### Local development

You can invoke your function locally by using the following command:

```bash
serverless invoke local --function ping
```

Which should result in response similar to the following:

```
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "body": "{Ping Successful!!}"
}
```
# Test your function locally

Alternatively, it is also possible to emulate API Gateway and Lambda locally by using `serverless-offline` plugin. In order to do that, execute the following command:

```bash
serverless plugin install -n serverless-offline
```

It will add the `serverless-offline` plugin to `devDependencies` in `package.json` file as well as will add it to `plugins` in `serverless.yml`.

After installation, you can start local emulation with:

```
serverless offline
```
